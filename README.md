### Hi there 👋

My name is Fabian, and I'm a Data Science and Engineering Student at University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg.

- 👨🏻‍💻 My purpose is to increase efficiency and competitiveness in Europe through data-driven applications. I'm still a learner, but this will never change.
- I truly believe that computer systems should always work FOR people, not against them. We should automate but also collaborate.
